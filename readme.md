# Queuete Hub aka Queuetuchi

This is a very simple IoT project whose aim is simple:

Hide the ugliness that is multiple "smart" IoT light systems behind a single, clean AWS IoT api.

In other words, I have a number of smart lighting systems (wemo, hue, tp-link, etc), and some have nice APIs (Hue) and some do not (wemo), but I wanted a clear interface.
